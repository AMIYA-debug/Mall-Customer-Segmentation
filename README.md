# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

##  Algorithm
This project uses the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm, an **unsupervised machine learning** method.  
- It partitions data into `k` clusters based on similarity.  
- Each customer is grouped by **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**.  
- The algorithm iteratively adjusts **cluster centroids** to minimize the within-cluster variance.  

In short, customers with similar income and spending patterns are grouped together,  
helping businesses understand distinct customer categories.

##  Use Case
Customer segmentation enables businesses to design **targeted marketing strategies**:  
- **High income, High spending** → Premium customers → Offer exclusive memberships.  
- **High income, Low spending** → Careful/Frugal customers → Provide discounts.  
- **Average income, Average spending** → Standard customers → Give loyalty rewards.  
- **Low income, High spending** → Impulsive buyers → Promote flash sales.  
- **Very High income, Low spending** → Conservative customers → Offer personalized services.  

By leveraging clustering, companies can **increase customer satisfaction**  
and **maximize revenue** through **personalized offers**.
